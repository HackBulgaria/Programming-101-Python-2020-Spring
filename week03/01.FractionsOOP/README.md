# Fractions OOP

Remember the Fractions problems you had to solve two weeks ago ([link](https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Programming-101-Python-2020-Spring/tree/master/week02/03.MoreTesting#simplify-fractions))? You will have to rewrite them today using your new OOP knowledge.

0. Preserve the functions from your previous solutions.
1. Reimplement them using TDD and OOP.
1. You will need to have a Fraction class.
1. Your old tests may need to be refactored.
1. You will have to override some dunders in order to collect and sort fractions.
1. We will expect to have "1/3" (for example) when we try to case our fraction to a string.
