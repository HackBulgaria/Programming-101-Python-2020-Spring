# Polynomials and Derivates

## Polynomials

In math, [a polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial) is a function, defined like that:

```
f(x) = Cn*x^n + Cn-1*x^n-1 + ... + c1*x^1 + c0
```

where:

- `Cn` to `C0` are coefficients. **We are going to work with positive integers for coefficients.**
- `x` is the variable and `x^n` means x to the power of `n`
- If the given coefficient is equal to `1`, it can be omitted.

Here are few examples:

```
f(x) = 2x^3 + 3x + 1
f'(x) = 6x + 3
```

## Derivatives

A derivative of a polynomial function is easily calculated. The only thing that we need to know is how to take derivative from each member of the polynomial function.

Here is the general rule for taking derivative of a function in the following form:

```
f(x) = c * x^n
f'(x) = n * c * x^(n - 1)
```

Where `c` and `n` are integers and `f'(x)` denotes the derivative of `f(x)`

There are two corner cases:

Taking derivative of `x` to the power of 1.

```
f(x) = c * x
f'(x) = c
```

and taking derivatives of constants:

```
f(x) = c
f'(x) = 0
```

So if we want to take the derivative of a polynomial function, we just apply that rule to every member of the polynom:

```
f(x) = 2x^3 + 3x + 1
f'(x) = 6*x^2 + 3
```

## Your task

Using your OO knowledge, implement a program that takes a string, representing a polynomial function and returns / prints the derivative of that polynomial function.

Few examples:

```
$ python3 solution.py '2*x^3+x'
Derivative of f(x) = 2*x^3 + x is:
f'(x) = 6*x^2 + 1
```

```
$ python3 solution.py '1'
The derivative of f(x) = 1 is:
f'(x) = 0
```

```
$ python3 solution.py 'x^4+10*x^3'
The derivative of f(x) = x^4 + 10*x^3 is:
f'(x) = 4*x^3 + 30*x^2
```

Few things to keep in mind:

```
$ python3 solution.py '1+x^2'
The derivative of f(x) = x^2 + 1 is:
f'(x) = 2x
```

And

```
$ python3 solution.py '3x^2'
The derivative of f(x) = 3x^2 is:
f'(x) = 6*x
```

Don't bother checking if the polynomial is correct for it's variable. It's always going to be the same ( for example `x`)

## Hints

Do not forget to test your implementation.
Of course, think wisely and create your program in a way that is independent from the console input/output.
