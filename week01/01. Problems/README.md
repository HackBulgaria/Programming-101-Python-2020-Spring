﻿Python Problems==============## Divisible by a given numberFind all numbers in the list `n` which are divisible by a given integer `d`.### Signature```pythondef divisible_by_d(n: list, d: int) -> list:    pass```### Test examples```python>>> divisible_by_d([1,2,3,4,5,6], 3)[3, 6]>>> divisible_by_d([0,1,2,3,4,5,6], 4)[0, 4]>>> divisible_by_d([0], 4)[0]>>> divisible_by_d([1,3,5], 2)[]```## Knight valid positions countGiven a tuple with two indexes than denotes the knight position on a matrix board, return the count of all valid positions which the knight can made.### Signature```pythondef knight_positions(pos: tuple) -> int:    # pos[0] denotes the knights row    # pos[1] denotes the knights column    pass```Consider these graphical examples`There are maximum eight legal positons`| M | 0| 1 | 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7|| - |::| :| :| :| :| :| :| :| | **0**| | | | | | | | || **1** | | | | | | | | || **2** | | | *| | *| | | || **3** | | *| | | | *| | || **4** | | | |K | | | | || **5** | | *| | | | *| | || **6** | | | *| | *| | | || **7** | | | | | | | | |`Example with only two legal moves`| M | 0| 1 | 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7|| - |::| :| :| :| :| :| :| :| | **0**| | | | | | | | || **1** | | | | | | | | || **2** | | | | | | | | || **3** | | | | | | | | || **4** | | | | | | | | || **5** | | | | | | | *| || **6** | | | | | | *| | || **7** | | | | | | | | K|
